<h2>Overview of the Dept. of Computer Science:</h2></font>
<font size="5" color="blue">Our college is one of the first few institutions in A.P to start a 3-year degree course in Computer Science in the year 1986-'87 with a modest beginning with one section MPCS (Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science) and 2 staff members. The first batch passed out with 100% result. Later on, Computer Science was offered with other combinations Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science, Mathematics, Electronics and Computer Science on demand. Keeping the strength in view the infrastructure has been enhanced with the needed software and more number of labs. B.Sc. (Data Science) course has been introduced form the year 2020-21.</p></font>
